# Fundamentals

This repository is a resource for both novice programmers aiming to learn the basics and seasoned developers seeking to
brush up on their foundational knowledge or learn new concepts. The code examples in this repository are written in
Python.

### Algorithms

The Algorithms directory contains basic to advanced algorithm concepts. These include but are not limited to sorting,
searching, graph theory, dynamic programming, divide and conquer, and others. 

### Data Structures

Data Structures are the building blocks of software development. In this directory, you will find the implementations
and usage of various data structures like Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, Trees, Graphs, and others.

### Design Patterns

Design Patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They are best practices that a programmer
can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system. The Design Patterns directory includes
examples of creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns.

### Python Fundamentals

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language with easy syntax. However, it has many nuances that can be
leveraged to write cleaner and more efficient code. This section includes Python basics and best practices for writing
Pythonic code.

### Low-Level Design

Low-Level Design focuses on the component-level design and is the first step into the design phase after deciphering
requirements. This directory contains examples of common low-level design problems and their solutions.
